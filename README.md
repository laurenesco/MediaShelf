# MediaShelf
A media management application focused on serving data to users through various API's, and allowing the user to track their favorite media of all types. This application aims to allow users to track all types of media in one place, including movies, TV shows, books, video games, and music. It is connected to four API's which deliver real time data about what media is available. 

The application is built using C#, and utilizes the .NET framework using Windows Forms.

This project originated as the final project for StMU CS 3340
